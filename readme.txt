Open Badge Factory is an Open Badge management system. Set up automatic badge awarding rules, and users will earn badges.

== Description ==

Your users complete steps, demonstrate skills and knowledge, and earn digital badges.

Create badges and set up the achievements to earn them. Badges are Mozilla OBI compatible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is an Open Badge? =

Open Badges is an online standard to recognize and verify learning. It was created by the Mozilla Foundation in 2011 and has been adopted by schools, vocational and public organizations and companies around the world.

Open Badges was developed because there is a strong need in our web-enabled society to recognize and demonstrate all the informal learning that happens through work, hobbies, volunteering and various other activities in our lives.

The idea behind badges is familiar from military and scouting organizations. An Open Badge is a digital picture, which contains metadata. The metadata provides information about the issuer of the badge and the criteria used to recognize the skills and achievements of the badge earner. This makes an Open Badge a trusted open credential, with validated evidence of learning.

Because the system is based on an open standard, the earner can combine multiple badges from different issuers to tell a more complete story of his or her achievements. The earner can display the badges in his or her e-Portfolio or share them on the Web for employment, social networking, education or lifelong learning purposes.

= What is Open Badge Factory? =

Open Badge Factory is what your organization needs if you are planning on designing and managing a meaningful, consistent and sustainable badge system that will build your reputation over time!

= Are the badges created by Open Badge Factory compatible with the Mozilla Open Badges Infrastructure? =

Yes. The badges created and issued by Open Badge Factory fully align with the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI) developed by Mozilla.

= Can we use OBF for free or is there a charge? =
